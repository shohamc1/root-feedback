## How to get this running

1. Initialise the folder using `git init` and get the files using `git clone https://github.com/shohamc1/root-feedback.git`
2. Make sure you have `pipenv` installed (`pip install pipenv`)
3. Get the requirements using `pipenv install`
4. `cd feedback/`
5. Open the virtual environment using `pipenv shell`
6. Run the thing by `python manage.py runserver`

Note: Wordcloud functionality has been removed, maybe can add it later for the main feedback page
